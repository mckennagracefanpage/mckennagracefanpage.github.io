					<p>Mckenna Grace is such a amazing actress, i personally watched most of her interview's in every single one she said " <i>I want to make a difference and impact in other people life through my acting</i> " that was her dream not awards or anything else.<br><br>Today a friend of mine also a mckenna fan post a song that she wrote in the pandamic because all the pain she felt that time, mckenna's songs makes people feel better including me, because of those lines and her voice. it's always therapeutic like she said, my friend also get better. She tried to join a band but that didn't go well, she pratically lost hope after that, Then she remember once mckenna said " <i>If you're going through rough times, just stick around, cause everything has to end eventually</i> " mckenna does make a impact in people's life like my friend, me and so lot of other's like she wanted i proud to say that i'm Mckennagrace fan<br><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cn981LHNbRz/">Song that friend wrote</a></p>
